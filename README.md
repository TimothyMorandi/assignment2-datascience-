Road Accident Severity Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the severity of road accidents using a dataset containing various factors such as time, day of the week, driver characteristics, vehicle type, and road conditions. A linear regression model is used to predict accident severity, and the results are visualized to provide insights into the factors influencing accident severity.
